        <p class="firstAnimation">CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style
            configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a
            set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible
            intermediate waypoints.
        </p>

        <p class="secAnimation">Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance
            and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't
            currently visible.
        </p>


        <div>
            <h1 class="heading">Move and lets watch</h1>
            <p>
                The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in
                JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as
                smooth as possible.
            <p>
                They're easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript.

                    <p>After you've configured the animation's timing, you need to define the appearance of the
                        animation. This is done by establishing one or more keyframes using the @keyframes at-rule.</p>
